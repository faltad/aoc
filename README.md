Advent of Code
==============

This is my own set of  [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) solutions in
Python.

For the uninitiated, [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) is a series of
programming challenges, a new one is released each day until Dec. 25th.

Each challenge requires thinking in a different way to solve it.

Notes
-----

- I'm not aiming for the perfect code but a correct and acceptale solution.
- This is about 2016 challenges
- Thanks to the author!
